**Todd Michael Semelbauer**

Hi, my name is Todd Michael Semelbauer. I'm an entrepreneur and creator focused on helping people achieve their goals - big or small - faster than they thought possible. Knowledge and understanding are prerequisites for success in just about every domain. Putting these into practice is the only way to create real value for yourself, your family, and the community.

I base everything I create and every product and service I deliver on earning your trust by putting you first. One of my core values is simple: people matter before profit, before systems, before technology. No matter how powerful technology becomes, it's only a tool — People will always come first.

I write practical guides to share real-world, proven knowledge with you, based on my active experience and lessons from my 25-year career as a Business Analyst and Product Owner for national and international companies based in the Midwest. If I can improve my products or services, please let me know by email.

I live in Michigan with my wonderful wife, Chris, and am the proud father of two great children.
