## 2. Glanceable Script (For before you walk in)

**The Hook:**
"I'm building a 24/7 front desk for contractors that answers every call and books jobs using the marketing you already paid for — without replacing your people."

**The "Not a Salesman" Line:**
"I'm not a contractor — you're the expert there. My background is 20+ years in business systems. I build things that work so you stop losing money."

**The Ask:**
"I'm looking for a few founding clients to test this. No upfront cost, 90-day guarantee. I just want to see if it helps your business."
