                    <h3 class="faq-question">Does this really work?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">We don't do marketing. We run your front office. Every call answered. Every lead filtered. Every job booked. You'll see results in the first week. One saved job usually pays for the entire service.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">Will customers know it's automated?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">No — and here's why: Customers don't analyze voices. They care that someone answers fast, is friendly, and gets them help immediately. Our front desk sounds like a calm, professional office receptionist. If anything unusual comes up, the call routes to you or your staff instantly.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">I've tried answering services before. They were terrible.</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Those were offshore call centers that just take messages. We're nothing like that. We qualify leads, route real customers, follow up on estimates, and book jobs. We run your front office, not just answer phones.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">Does this replace my office person?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">No. It makes them more efficient. We handle the repetitive, stressful work (after-hours calls, overflow, intake, spam filtering) so your people can focus on important tasks. Your staff is the heart of your business — we protect them from burnout.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">What if it books the wrong job?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">We qualify every lead first using your rules: service area, job types, budget, urgency. You approve the filters. We only book jobs you want. And if we're ever unsure, we escalate to you immediately.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How much does this cost?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Less than hiring even a part-time office person — and you get full 24/7 coverage. One saved job per month usually covers the entire service. Most contractors save way more than one job per month.</p>

Here's the difference: I show you exactly what we did each month — calls handled, jobs booked, revenue touched, reviews generated. You'll see: "We would've missed X jobs without this." Real results, real accountability.</p>

                    <p class="founder-greeting">Hi, I'm Todd Semelbauer.</p>

                    <p>For 20+ years, I've worked in business systems engineering, helping companies solve operational problems. I live in Southwest Michigan, and I kept seeing the same pattern:</p>

                    <p>Hard-working contractors — HVAC companies, plumbers, electricians, roofers — losing thousands of dollars every month because no one answered the phone when it rang.</p>

                    <p>Not because they were bad at their jobs. Because they were <em>busy doing the job.</em></p>

                    <p>Techs in attics. Owners on roofs. Office staff juggling five things at once. After-hours emergencies going to voicemail.</p>

                    <p>And while they were working, jobs went to competitors who answered faster.</p>

                    <p>I didn't want to sell them more leads. They were already paying for leads. <strong>They needed to protect the revenue they'd already earned.</strong></p>

                    <p>So I built NeverLoseAJob — a 24/7 front-desk service that answers every call, qualifies every customer, and books real jobs automatically.</p>

                    <p>This isn't a marketing tool. It's revenue protection. And it works alongside your team, not instead of them.</p>
